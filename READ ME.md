## CONTEXT

### This is a simple coding testing suggested by Rock Content Marketing Place Team to assess some basic knowledge about C# and .NET framework skills.

#### I would like to highlight that I put lots of efforts on it and did not use the prerogative to consult any sort of expert mate or some of open community to have my job done by someone else. I believe that this is such an important approach to show right now since I am strongly interested in join Rock Content and one of the most important parts of this new win-win relationship is the frankness of both sides. So, maybe I have committed some mistakes and I would appreciate if you guys could show me that to improve my learning process.

### About like button feature

#### First of all I would like to explain that I tried to solve the challenge with two different approaches. The first one was using the following steps:

- To develop a solution for the challenge, SignalR Library for ASP.NET was used. This library provides a real-time web functionality which has the ability to have server code push content to connect clients in real time as soon as they become available. This ability represents all the CRUD operations.

- SignalR library was used within the Blazor framework, which is build by Microsoft for creating interactive client-side web user interface with .NET. 

- For to be able to get real-time information, it is needed to implement a server side- class called Hub. Through the hub, it is possible to define a user in a unique way, by its IPAdress.
- I also used a NuGet library server-side oriented called Ninject.

- On the client-side, the code counts with some icon provided by FontAwesome.

I am really sorry to say that I sort of mess up my code. Maybe I tried to dig too much deeper and then I was unable to deal with so many new things for me. On this approach it was necessary to work with hubs, repositories, JavaScrips and entities and I kind of felt lost doing the work.



#### Second approach was made following a tutorial provided by Microsoft Learn: Build your first Blazor App

- On this scenario, I could create a simple webpage with a controller which are able to count the number of likes clicks.
- This path looks like the more suitable for the Task - using ASP.NET Core Wep App MVC (Model-View-Controller). This process is reasonable to connect with a database and provide real-time information about action and views of Controllers. By the way, a Controller is going to be a structure to count and storage the number of likes in a page.
- I should follow this approach, since the KISS (keep it simple, stupid!) way of works looks like the best option for the suggested task.  :smile:

#### Again, I want to highlight that I put a lot of effort and really enjoyed the challenge and I am strongly eager to learn more and win knowledge from expert mates. I am excited to know how is the correct way to develop the like button feature. :smirk:



#### Some details about references I used 

- https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/aspnet/blazor-tutorial/create

- https://docs.microsoft.com/pt-br/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/start-mvc?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=visual-studio - P.S.: this is probably the best reference to develop the task.

- https://jonhilton.net/build-a-like-button-using-razor-components/

- FontAwesome.com - for grab some nice icons

- Google Chrome extensions - ColorZilla and What Font - to discover about colors and fonts that Rock Content use on its pages. Just a try to mimic the Rock Content Design patterns.

- Razor Componentes. Blazor App and NuGet libraries.

- http://www.danylkoweb.com/Blog/how-to-make-your-own-real-time-like-button-using-aspnet-mvc-jquery-and-signalr-QF. and https://github.com/jdanylko/LikeButtonDemo. P.S.: this are the references I used the most. Maybe this was a mistake since I tried to developed something too much advanced for me and then I got stuck in the task. Looking on the bright side, I discovered a nice reference to follow with great material for .NET beginners and I will for sure study this content.

  

  ## To sum up, I just want to thank you guys so much. I am admiring Rock Content a lot and I am thrilled to the possibility to work with you. Please, give me an opportunity and I will work hard! I am looking forward seeing you guys soon. :pray: :muscle: :construction_worker: :relaxed:
